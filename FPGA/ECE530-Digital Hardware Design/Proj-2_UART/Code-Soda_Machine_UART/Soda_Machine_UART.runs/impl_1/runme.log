If this cell is a user instantiated LUT in the design, please remove connectivity to the pin or change the equation and/or INIT string of the LUT to prevent this issue.

WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net TxFIFO_wr_reg_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin TxFIFO_wr_reg_LDC_i_1/O, cell TxFIFO_wr_reg_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
